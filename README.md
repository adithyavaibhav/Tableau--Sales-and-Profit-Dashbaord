# Finance Report Dashboard

This repository presents a Finance Report Dashboard that analyzes discounts, order and return trends, regional sales performance, and segment-wise profitability. The dashboard helps in understanding overall business performance and identifying key growth areas.

## Dashboard Overview

The Finance Report is divided into four main analytical sections:

* Total Discount on Products
* Number of Orders vs Returns per Year
* Region-Wise Total Sales and Quantity
* Segment-Wise Profit Analysis

Each section focuses on a different aspect of financial and operational performance.

## Total Discount on Products

This section visualizes the total discount applied across different product categories.

The categories included are Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.

Office Supplies account for the highest total discount, indicating aggressive pricing or higher promotional activity. Furniture follows with a moderate discount level, while Technology has the lowest total discount. This analysis helps in understanding discount distribution and its impact on profit margins.

## Number of Orders vs Returns per Year

This section compares the number of orders and returns across the years 2022 to 2025.

Orders show a consistent upward trend, reflecting steady business growth. Returns also increase over time but remain significantly lower than orders. The widening gap between orders and returns suggests improved customer satisfaction and product quality.

## Region-Wise Total Sales and Quantity

This section displays total sales and quantity sold across regions using a map-based visualization.

The United States contributes the majority of total sales and quantity, making it the primary revenue-generating region. Canada shows comparatively lower sales and quantity, highlighting potential opportunities for regional expansion or targeted marketing strategies.

## Segment-Wise Profit Analysis

This section analyzes profit and order quantity across customer segments on a monthly basis.

The Consumer segment generates the highest profit overall, followed by the Corporate segment, which shows steady and consistent performance. The Home Office segment records the lowest profit but maintains stable sales. Profit levels tend to increase toward the later months of the year, indicating possible seasonal demand patterns.

## Conclusion

The Finance Report Dashboard provides valuable insights into discount strategies, sales growth, regional performance, and customer segment profitability. These insights can be used to improve pricing strategies, optimize regional focus, and enhance overall business decision-making.

## Dashboard Overview

Each section highlights a specific aspect of sales and profit performance.

## Sales by Category

Total sales show a consistent upward trend, with significant growth in the later years. The profit ratio also improves over time, peaking around 2024 before showing a slight variation in 2025. This indicates healthy revenue growth accompanied by stable profitability.

## Region-wise Sales Contribution

This section analyzes sales contribution across different regions.

The regions included are Central, East, South, and West.

The West region contributes the highest overall sales, followed by the East region. The Central region shows moderate performance, while the South region has the lowest contribution. This comparison helps identify high-performing and underperforming regions.
